Excellent — here’s a prompt suite you can feed into AI agents (or separate tasks for tools like Claude, GPT, Copilot, etc.) to drive targeted improvements to your Tickets frontend.

It’s split into six logical chunks that correspond to distinct scopes of work — each chunk is self-contained and written as an AI-ready instruction.

⸻

🧩 Prompt 1: Core Feature Completion

Goal: Extend the Tickets UI to use 100% of backend functionality.

Instruction:
Improve the existing React + Vite frontend by adding all missing core ticket management features. Implement:
	•	Ticket creation (modal + full-page view).
	•	Comments with markdown support, @mentions, edit/delete, and live updates via WebSocket.
	•	File attachments for tickets and comments (drag & drop + preview).
	•	Advanced search and filtering (by status, priority, assignee, keyword, custom fields).
	•	Bulk actions for tickets (assign/unassign, status change, label edit).
	•	Inline editing with optimistic updates and undo/redo.

Ensure full backend API integration, graceful error handling, and form validation. Use local storage to persist unsaved drafts.

🧩 Prompt 2: UX & Design System

Goal: Modernise UI with consistent visual language.

Instruction:
Refactor the frontend to adopt a consistent design system (Material UI or Ant Design).
	•	Replace ad-hoc components with reusable UI primitives (Button, Input, Modal, Tag, Dropdown, DataGrid).
	•	Apply a global theme (light/dark modes, colour tokens, spacing).
	•	Add responsive layouts for mobile and tablet.
	•	Include empty states, skeleton loaders, and consistent icons.
	•	Integrate accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA): ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, focus management, screen reader support.
	•	Document components with Storybook.

⸻

🧩 Prompt 3: State Management & Data Layer

Goal: Improve data flow and performance.

Instruction:
	•	Introduce TypeScript for full type safety.
	•	Replace manual fetch calls with React Query (TanStack Query) for caching, retries, and background refetch.
	•	Implement WebSocket or SSE connections for real-time updates.
	•	Optimise ticket lists using virtualisation (react-window).
	•	Add pagination and cursor-based navigation.
	•	Use React Router v7 data APIs (loaders/actions/defer) for data fetching and mutations.
	•	Centralise API configuration and error handling.

⸻

🧩 Prompt 4: Security & Authentication

Goal: Harden the app against security vulnerabilities.

Instruction:
	•	Replace token storage in localStorage with httpOnly cookies where possible.
	•	Add refresh token rotation and silent session renewal.
	•	Implement role-based access control (UI visibility and feature gating).
	•	Add CSRF protection, input sanitisation, and secure markdown rendering.
	•	Configure strict CSP and Subresource Integrity for third-party scripts.
	•	Log out on multiple tab updates using BroadcastChannel API.

⸻

🧩 Prompt 5: Observability, Performance & Testing

Goal: Enhance reliability and monitoring.

Instruction:
	•	Integrate Sentry (error reporting + performance tracing).
	•	Add Web Vitals and performance budgets (LCP ≤ 2.5s, INP ≤ 200ms, CLS ≤ 0.1).
	•	Apply code splitting and lazy loading (route-based + component-level).
	•	Use compression, hashed static assets, and image optimisation.
	•	Add unit tests (Vitest + RTL) and end-to-end tests (Playwright or Cypress).
	•	Add accessibility testing (axe-core) and visual regression (Chromatic).
	•	Set up GitHub Actions or CI pipeline for lint, build, test, and deploy.

⸻

🧩 Prompt 6: Dashboard, Analytics & Extras

Goal: Provide management insights and user personalisation.

Instruction:
	•	Add advanced dashboard widgets: open vs closed tickets, SLA breaches, workload by user/team, trend charts.
	•	Allow users to save custom filter views and pin them to the dashboard.
	•	Implement notifications (toast + inbox).
	•	Add audit trail (who changed what, when).
	•	Optional: Add PWA support for offline viewing and background sync.
	•	Integrate feature flags for staged rollout (e.g., ConfigCat/LaunchDarkly).
	•	Add analytics events for key flows (login, filter, update, comment).

Would you like me to combine these into a master AI task file (JSON or Markdown spec) that you can drop into a multi-agent system or task runner? It would include structured task names, dependencies, and expected outputs for each phase.
