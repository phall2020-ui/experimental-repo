+# Tickets — Asset Manager Edition
+
+> **Terminology update**
+>
+> Throughout this project, the term **Tenant** has been replaced with **Asset manager**.  An asset manager represents an isolated organisation or group of users within the system.  Where variables or interfaces previously used `tenant` or `tenantId`, they should now use `assetManager` or `assetManagerId`.  Documentation and environment variable examples have been updated accordingly.

+## UI Improvements
+
+The following UI improvements lay the foundation for a high‑performance, enterprise‑grade experience and have been incorporated in this iteration:
+
+### Scalable tables and dashboards
+
+- **Virtualised ticket tables**: The dashboard now uses row virtualisation to render only visible rows.  This dramatically improves responsiveness when browsing thousands of tickets and reduces memory consumption.  Pagination, lazy loading and typeahead search further optimise large dataset handling.
+- **Interactive dashboards**: Key metrics (open vs closed tickets, SLA breaches, agent workload) are displayed on interactive dashboards.  Users can filter by status, priority or date range without full‑page reloads.
+
+### Multi‑user collaboration
+
+- **Role‑aware navigation**: The UI adapts based on whether you are an asset manager admin or a regular agent, showing the appropriate navigation and tools.
+- **Real‑time presence indicators**: When multiple agents view the same ticket, avatars indicate who is present.  The system warns users of concurrent edits and prevents conflicting submissions.
+- **Internal notes and mentions**: Agents can add private notes and @mention colleagues, facilitating collaboration without exposing conversations to end‑users.
+
+These improvements set the stage for further enhancements such as proactive collision detection, watchers, and advanced analytics.
